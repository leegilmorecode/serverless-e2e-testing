## Introduction

Serverless architecture has revolutionised the way we build and deploy applications, offering scalability, cost efficiency, and reduced operational overhead. However, as the complexity of serverless systems grows, ensuring their reliability becomes paramount.

Testing serverless solutions thoroughly is crucial to guaranteeing their functionality, performance, and resilience.

In this article, we delve into the world of serverless testing, focusing on integration, end-to-end, and unit testing. We explore how to effectively test serverless applications using the AWS CDK and the power of TypeScript.

> Note: This is not production ready is and is created for talking through key aspects of serverless testing.
